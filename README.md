# OpenCV-project


### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is a project that integrates convolutional neural network(CNN), OpenCV, and Flask. The purpose is to classify healthy and sick images using computer vision and neural network. The technical design is like the followings:
* start training the CNN model using healthy and sick faces image data
* run the CNN model, save it inside the JSON file, and integrate with OpenCV using a data model
* use Flask to display the index.html file, which shows user's face health condition

### Dataset
Currently using random healthy and sick faces images

### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In order to run this program, users need to install keras and opencv-python
* In the terminal, type: python3 cnn.py to train the model first
* Next, type: python3 main.py
